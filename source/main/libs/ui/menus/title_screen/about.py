Hi!

Thanks for trying this out! I put a lot of time and effort into this.

It was a blast making this for most of the time (except, of course, when
python didn't do what i wanted it to do and i didn't know why but anyway)!

This project made me realize a lot of things:
    1 - I am way worse at coding than I thought :(
    2 - I hate Python
    3 - C is better (yes even though it has pointers, i know)
    3 - imo, two weeks is kinda short ngl

And for the ones that like to dig into the code:
    [Softly]
     Don't.

Why? Because this code is the most spaghetti code I've written!
It's borderline unreadable!
Don't read it! For your own sanity!
Plus at the end i was kinda tired of this so some solutions to my problems
were...  o u t s t a n d i n g .
(don't try to reproduce this at home)

Anyway have fun with this!
(There are secrets btw ;) | In several senses... )

It feels kinda weird writing this, it's been two weeks of super intense
work on this and now it's finished... wow

idk what to say at the end so jave this:
    - be nice
    - be trustworthy
    - be tolerant
    - love your loved ones
    - try to understand others and the way and reason(s) they act the way they do
    - never put your ideals in the background
    - thigh-highs and arm-warmers are the best articles of clothing
    - reject your humanity ; return to  m o n k e
    - Memento Mori. UNUS ANNUS.
