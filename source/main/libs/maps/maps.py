        § Amplify weapons on Wallhammer.

    % FIXME:
        % Target compromised: move in, move in.

        & FIX:
            & Overwatch, target one sterilized.

    µ WHYNOT:
        µ make a floor list with room class instances, use index with movement()?

    ! IMPORTANT:
        ! Roger that. Waiting for contact. Over.
