Cleverly done.


It was about time...
Sorry, may I have your name -again-?


Ah.
That's right.


As I said, it was about time you arrived, {}.
We have been expecting you.


#


As they have witnessed the causes of this... situation,
my employer has become interested in your "services".


They are ready to offer you a... "constrained" contract.
They believe that in you lies the potential for a... deviation.

Of course, I believe you do consider this offer to be of such an
importance that it... cannot be refused.


Again, cleverly done, {}, but you're not supposed to be here.
As a matter of fact, you're not.
You actually belong in a much more... "manifold" system.


That's why I'm here, {}.
Although rather than offer you the illusion of free choice,
I will take the liberty of choosing for you... "how" and
"when" your time comes around again.


My employer previously mobilized a "sizable" number of hires ;
To no effect in the matters of their... "fruition".
We had not found a suitable heir to these heirs,
up until your "arrival" in this "structure".


As a side note, I would like to add that as much as we all
do, -You- should prepare for unforseen consequences.


On these weighted strings of words...
This is where I get off.
